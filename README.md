# DSM API Proof of Concept

ðŸ‘‹Hi! Thanks for visiting this project. We've set out to create accessible examples using [InVision Design System Manager (DSM)](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager). This example includes the following:

#### Fetching styles from DSM
- See [`src/utils/fetchStyles.js`](https://github.com/martinlaws/dsm-todos/blob/master/src/utils/fetchStyles.js) to see how styles are being fetched, parsed, and returned from DSM's JSON API.
- See [`vue.config.js`](https://github.com/martinlaws/dsm-todos/blob/master/vue.config.js) to see how the styles fetched above are loaded in as [Ant Design Vue theme customizations](https://vue.ant.design/docs/vue/customize-theme/).
